# Access Control

In url: "/?page=survey#" we can see a survey (surprising ?).

We can vote for someone and inspect the body of the POST request:

```
sujet=2&valeur=5
```

Change the value of sujet and nothing append.

Change the value of valeur to 100 for example and we have the flag in response.
